# AndroidApp
Android application for technical evaluation at Altitude Labs

Dear Justin Yek,
I have completed the application according to the mockup via Android Studio. The application was stored in app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk  However, This is the first time of me for using Github.
Would you kindly let me know whether you agree with the application for approval?
Thank you
